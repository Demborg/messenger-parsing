# Messenger data parsing
Playing around with my data dump from facebook messenger

## Making a playlist from song mentions in a messenger chat
The first thing I tried was to build a spotify playlist from all the song mentions in a chat I have with some friends. The `semlor37.ipnb` notebook was what I used for that and the playlist is available [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/dr.lexa/playlist/7DdH0Ogd8plJ0UEUc3KsfL?si=ZAdXPMTERBaNSlGELHG4TA)

## Ideas:
- Look at frequencies of interactions in a chat
- Do sentiment analysis on messages sent in relations I have been in?
